    				<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
      				<p>Marketing, its a common factor in our every day life. 
      				But has marketing gotten so constant that you don’t even notice anymore? 
      				Between email ads, promoted social posts, banner ads and more, 
      				almost every time we are on the internet we are bound to see a brand pushing 
      				its message or products on us. With all these ads, consumers are often faced 
      				with what is considered “clutter.” They see so many ads every day that they tune them out, 
      				making it harder for marketers to push through and stand out.
					I decided to test this theory out, was I really tuning out online ads, 
					and if not how many was I truly interacting with everyday.</p>

					<h3><b> A Week Long Process </b></h3>
					<p>The process of collecting my data was an all day affair for one whole week. 
					Every time I noticed an ad or interacted with it I would detail the interaction 
					I had with that advertisement in terms of: time, message content, brand, industry,
					if I clicked on the website, what was my rationale, how long did I interact and how 
					did I receive the advertisement (device, platform and delivery). </p>

					<p>As you can imagine it was at times a painstaking process to collect this all, 
					but through perseverance I managed to make it through the week and discovered some 
					interesting correlations in my data. The most interesting and prevalent of which was,
					<em>Time</em>. When I state <em>time</em>, I am referring to the time of day I would be 
					interacting with an advertisement. </p>

				<h3><b> What Does this mean</b></h3>
					<p> Think of it as a clock. By the notches, you can understand the temporal chart's relation
					to time. While many clocks run on a 24 hour basis, I chose to communicate my data through a 24 hour
					clock, as I was interacting with online advertisements on a range larger than 12 hours. 
					</p>
					<p> The attributes around the clock represent each time I interacted with an online advertisement. 
					The color denotes what platform I viewed it on (social media, email, website banner ad), while the size 
					denotes how long the interaction was, with the largest size being for 15 minutes or longer. The normal nature 
					of this interaction was visiting the website, which is denoted in the chart by the arrows coming off 
					the attributes, and looking at the products offered. 
					</p>
					<p> From this experiment, I made a couple of interesting observations. The first, is that 
					I had a larger tendency to engage with advertisements in the afternoon. The second that
					I had the largest tendency to interact with advertisements on social media in the evening, 
					approaching the time I would fall asleep. Lastly, was that I was very often seeing retargeted 
					banner ads on websites for products that I had looked at previously online.
					With this information, I began to see some of the ways marketers use our online tendencies and 
					tracking information to send us targeted ads.

					<h3><b>The Takeaway</b></h3>
					<p> As discussed above, my data collection allowed me to group and relate information 
					that lead to some interesting observations of my own online tendencies, as well 
					as uncovered some marketing strategies as well. 
					I wanted to dive deeper into this idea of retargeted online advertisements 
					and the way marketers use different technologies to track our online engagements. 
					</p>
					<p> <b>Let me preface you with an example - </b>
					 While collecting my data, I was in the process of buying a new bathing suit online. 
					I visited a number of sites, and viewed a couple of bathing suits at each, but one site
					in particular kept following me around. I would open up CNN to read the news, and 
					I would keep seeing the same two bathing suits again and again. I wondered, why these 
					and not the others ones I viewed. And then I realized, I had put them in my shopping cart. 
					Services like Google analytics can track your behavior with cookies and then can 
					send you targeted ads, or in the case, retargeted ads. The purpose of these ads
					was to remind me of the product I had placed in my cart and hopefully would 
					encourage me to make a buying decision. </p>
					
					<p> To learn more about the marketing phenomenon of retargeted marketing 
					please feel free to watch the following video and learn more about the tools
					marketers are using to break through the clutter of the current market.
